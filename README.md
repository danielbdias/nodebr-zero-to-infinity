# NodeBR 2018-04-13 Meetup Code Samples

This code shows steps of the lifecycle of a Node.js app.

- level-0: simple node app, written in a single file
- level-10: same app, with the components separated in responsabilities
- level-100: same app, with pm2 and winston logger used to help to detect problems in the app

- bonus: level-1000, another app that show concurrency problems that could happen when your user base grows
